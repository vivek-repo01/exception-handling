#Write a Python program that opens a file and handles a FileNotFoundError
# exception if the file does not exist.

# Define a function named open_file that takes a filename as a parameter.

# Prompt the user to input a file name and store it in the 'file_name' variable.
file_name = input("Input a file name: ")
